This is a project that I started as an "expansion" to a Hackathon project I did for MadHacks 2023 in the Spring.

Throughout this project, I hope to be able to continue to expand my knowledge of React, React Native, and general web design principles
as well as reading documentation, using APIs, and ultimately deploying an app, from start to finish. I plan to complete this project incrementally.

1. Be able to search for ingredients and add ingredients to the query [Completed : 6/6/2024]
2. Be able to query a list of recipes based on ingredients
3. Add tags/filters to perform faceted serach on recipes (cuisine style, prep time, nutrition, allergies...)
4. Be able to create an image to search feature where a user can take a picture of many ingredients on a table in order to perform a search
5. Allow users to be able to authenticate with firebase to "save" recipes to profile
6. Allow users to create reviews for recipes that can be seen by other users as well.
7. Perform user testing
8. Reiterate app based on user testing
